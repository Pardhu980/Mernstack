        <p>"It goes back to the very first incarnation of The Avengers, it goes to <a href="/wiki/Ultimates" title="Ultimates">The Ultimates</a>, it goes to everything about it. It makes no sense, it's ridiculous. There's a thunder god, there's a green '<a href="/wiki/Id_(Freud)" class="mw-redirect" title="Id (Freud)">id</a>' giant rage monster, there's Captain America from the 40s, there's Tony Stark who definitely doesn't get along with anybody. Ultimately these people don't belong together and the whole movie is about finding yourself from community. And finding that you not only belong together but you need each other, very much. Obviously this will be expressed through punching but it will be the heart of the film."
